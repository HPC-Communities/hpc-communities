# About HPC Communities

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/CASC-and-HPC-SIG.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

HPC Communities is an international collaboration founded by US Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC) and the UK High Performance Computing Special Interest Group (HPC-SIG).

We organise [[events]] where HPC organisations around the world can collaborate together, share their ideas and challenges and discuss issues such as sustainability.
